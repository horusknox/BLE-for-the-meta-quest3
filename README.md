# BLE-for-the-meta-quest3
This is a BLE app built with the Unity game Engine that connects to XOSS sensors and shows the number of rotations of the sensor. Using the library: https://github.com/Velorexe/Unity-Android-Bluetooth-Low-Energy

A ton of thanks to: https://github.com/Velorexe for the library.
This app is designed for the quest but it works on android devices too!
